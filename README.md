# Bakery Transaction Analysis

## Overview

This project involves an in-depth analysis of transaction data for a bakery using SQL queries. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights into the bakery's operations, such as transaction volumes, peak hours, and item-specific trends.

## Project Objectives

1. **Analyze Transaction Patterns**:
   - Examine how transaction counts vary by item, daypart (morning, afternoon, evening, night), and day type (weekday, weekend).

2. **Calculate Running Totals and Averages**:
   - Compute the running total of transactions for each item over time.
   - Calculate the average number of transactions for each item using a 7-day moving window.

3. **Compare with Long-Term Trends**:
   - Compare daily transaction counts against a 30-day moving average to identify deviations and trends.
